**TAConnect** is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It helps users quickly organize contacts into tutorial groups, tags, and custom fields (e.g., Telegram handles), with only names being mandatory. Fast CLI commands allow adding, viewing, editing, and searching contacts efficiently, while the GUI displays full details and organized lists.

**Target Users:** NUS Computer Science TAs

**Assumptions:** Users have basic computer literacy and are familiar with command-line operations.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAConnect.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar TAConnect.jar` command to run the application.

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 tg/@johndoe` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `view 2` : Displays the full details of the second contact in the current contact list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose attributes matches any of the given keywords on every field specified in the command flags.

Format: `find [n/NAME]… [p/PHONE_NUMBER]… [e/EMAIL]… [a/ADDRESS]… [tg/TELEGRAM_HANDLE]… [t/TAG]… [c/COURSE_CODE]… [tut/TUTORIAL_GROUP]…`

* Multiple fields can be specified here, persons matching all the predicates will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `n/hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the flags does not matter. e.g. `find n/Alex c/CS2103T` 
will have the same effect as `find c/CS2103T n/Alex`
* Partial matching is supported for longer fields (i.e. Name, Phone number, Email, Address, and Telegram handle).
e.g. `n/Han` will match `Hans`
* Exact matching is used for shorter fields (i.e. Tag, Course code, and Tutorial group). 
e.g. `c/CS210` won't match `CS2103T`
* To search by tutorial group, you must also provide a course code (e.g., `c/CS2103T tut/T01`). 
Which means commands like `find tut/T01` won't work.

Examples:
* `find n/John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find n/alex n/david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`
* `find c/CS2103T tut/T01` returns all students in CS2103T tutorial group T01.
* `find p/807 e/alex` returns all students with `807` in their phone number and has `alex` in their email address.

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

TAConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TAConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAConnect home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
